## My process

I started by adding the Tailwind CDN to enable Tailwind CSS. I then imported the Inter font and set the background color on the body to match the design. Using semantic HTML and Tailwind utility classes, I styled all elements according to the provided style guide. I also used CSS Grid to center the main container.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned that `place-items-center` in Tailwind is equivalent to using `justify-content` and `align-items` in CSS Grid. I also learned that Tailwind does not allow spaces in arbitrary values, so colors must be written like `bg-[hsl(75,94%,57%)]`.

I am most proud of my use of semantic HTML. If I were to rate myself, I would give this project an 8 or 9 out of 10.

### Continued development

In the future, I plan to replace the profile image and buttons with my own details to turn this into a personal profile card.
